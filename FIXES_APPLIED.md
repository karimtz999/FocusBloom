# Timer and Session Completion Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Timer Bug** ✅
- **Problem**: Timer was decrementing by 60 seconds instead of 1 second
- **Fixed**: Changed `return prev - 60` to `return prev - 1` in the timer effect
- **Location**: Line 58 in TimerScreen.tsx

### 2. **Initial Timer Duration** ✅
- **Problem**: Timer started at 20 minutes instead of 25 minutes
- **Fixed**: Changed `const [timeLeft, setTimeLeft] = useState(20 * 60)` to `25 * 60`
- **Location**: Line 25 in TimerScreen.tsx

### 3. **API Integration for Session Completion** ✅
- **Problem**: Sessions were only saved locally, not synced with API
- **Fixed**: 
  - Added import for `startPomodoroSession` and `completePomodoroSession`
  - Updated `handleSessionComplete` to use API integration
  - Updated `toggleTimer` to start sessions via API
  - Added `currentSessionId` state for tracking API sessions

### 4. **Session Tracking** ✅
- **Problem**: No proper session ID tracking for API calls
- **Fixed**: Added `currentSessionId` state variable to track sessions created via API

## How It Works Now

### Starting a Session
1. User clicks play button
2. App tries to create session via API
3. If API succeeds: session ID is stored for later completion
4. If API fails: session runs locally with fallback

### Completing a Session
1. Timer reaches zero
2. App tries to complete session via API using stored session ID
3. Session data is saved both via API and locally for redundancy
4. User gets completion alert with options to continue or take break
5. Session count increments and shows in history

### Data Flow
```
Start Timer → API Call → Session ID Stored → Timer Runs → 
Complete → API Call + Local Save → History Updated → 
Stats Available
```

## What the User Will See

1. **Proper Timer**: Timer now counts down correctly (1 second at a time)
2. **Correct Duration**: Work sessions are 25 minutes, not 20
3. **Data Persistence**: Sessions are saved and appear in history
4. **Statistics**: Total sessions and time are tracked properly
5. **Offline Support**: If API fails, sessions still work locally

## Testing

To test that everything works:

1. **Start a session**: Press play button - should start at 25:00
2. **Watch timer**: Should count down properly (25:00 → 24:59 → 24:58...)
3. **Complete session**: Let timer reach 00:00 or manually trigger completion
4. **Check history**: Go to explore tab to see completed session
5. **Verify data**: Session should appear with correct duration and timestamp

## Error Handling

- **API Unavailable**: Sessions continue to work locally
- **Network Issues**: Requests are queued for later sync
- **Timer Interruption**: Reset button properly clears session state
- **Data Consistency**: Local storage always maintains backup copy

The app now properly tracks sessions, saves them to both API and local storage, and displays accurate statistics in the history screen!
